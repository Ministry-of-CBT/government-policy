# Code of Conduct

Gregification is a process where an individual devotes time to Gregic modpacks such as GTNH, Supersymmetry, TerraFirmaGreg New Horizons, TerraFirmaRescue, Nomifactory CEu Hard Mode, and more. 

The Process of Gregification is divided into stages:
Gregification Alpha
Gregification Beta
Gregification Delta
Gregification Epsilon
Gregification Gamma
Gregification Zeta
Gregification Sigma
Gregification Omega

Each Gregification Stage corresponds to increasing levels of Greg on the personality, the moral code, and the values and actions of such individual.

The Gregic Code of Conduct are a series of directives that every gregger must follow. These are :
- Praise Greg
- Devote time to Greg
- Spread the Gregification
- Worship GregoriusT
- Play Gregic Modpacks Everyday
- Studying Chemistry, Physics and any branch of Science in real life as a major.
- Admire Gregic Complexity

Ungregic Actions atleast include:
- Spreading Anti-Greg Propoganda
- Mispelling the name of GregoriusT on purpose
- Admiring Mekanism instead of GregTech
- Being part of the acidic sons of mekanism
- Spreading anti-science propoganda.
- Impersonating the creator of GregTech

```
Notice all players!

It has been apparent to the Ministry of CBT that you have been abusing the 
sound button to block all daily gregic programming instilled by the Ministry
of CBT! We have decided to ban the use of all sound sliders and you will
no longer be able to mute any sound in Project CBT! 

We have recieved reports from some higher ups in Project CBT dev team and
with the evidence we found, we at Ministry of CBT have decided to take
action and mandate the removal of all volume buttons.

If you have any complaints, then explode you acidic son of Mekanism.
